    "# Extracting features from raw network data\n",
    "\n",
    "Welecome to this notebook! We will first explore how to extract features that we can use in our machine\n",
    "learning models from raw network data. Raw network data is usually stored in packet capture (PCAP) files.\n",
    "PCACP files store every byte of the packets which allows us to replay the network traffic at a later\n",
    "time. Unfortunately, machine learning models are unable to process raw bytes. Instead, machine learning\n",
    "models expect a numerical representation. After all, machine learning models are defined by a set of\n",
    "mathematical operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Not all the information in a PCAP will be relevant for our machine learning. A PCAP file can have\n",
    "millions of packets, many of which may contain little or no relevant information, such as\n",
    "acknowledgements, packets to keep a connection alive, etc. Therefore, we focus on \"packet flows\" (i.e.,\n",
    "TCP connections) instead of individual packets. \n",
    "\n",
    "We know that each DNS-over-HTTPS request will be sent over a TLS connection contained within a TCP connection. By extracting features about the TCP connection instead of individual packets we can significantly reduce the amount of data that we need to process with our machine learning models. \n",

    "|1|Number of sent bytes|\n",
    "|2|Number of received bytes|\n",

    "|4|Number of received packets|\n",
    "|5|Ratio of received to sent bytes|\n",
    "|6|Ratio of received to sent packets|\n",
    "|7|Length of connection in seconds|\n",
    "|8|Average received packet size|\n",
    "|9|Median received packet size|\n",
    "|10|Variance of received packet size|\n",
    "|11|Average sent packet size|\n",
